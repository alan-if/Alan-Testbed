# Directory Contents

- [`monokai.rb`][monokai.rb] — original `monokai` theme.
- [`monokai-adoc.css`][monokai-adoc.css] — extracted `monokai` CSS generated by Asciidoctor.

Reference documents:

- [`Rouge-Tokens.adoc`][Rouge-Tokens.adoc]
- [`Rouge-Tokens.html`][Rouge-Tokens.html] ([Live HTML Preview][Tokens Live])


# Asciidoctor HTML Tags

This how Asciidoctor renders and ALAN source block (`[source,alan3]`) in the generated HTML doc:

```html
<div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
        <pre class="rouge highlight">
            <code data-lang="alan3">
```

Since our goal is to provide a different theme for each syntax, and allow different themes for ALAN sources (via roles), we might have to tweak the generated tags, like we've done so far with Highlight, using Haml templates.

Here's how our customized HTML for Highlight looks like:

```html
<div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
        <pre class="highlight" lang="alan">
            <code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">
```

Thanks to the extra `lang="alan` on the `<pre>` tag, and the the `language-alan` class on the `<code>` tag, we're able to gain full control over the styles of source code block, on a per-language bases.

We also have two alternative themes for ALAN, associated with the `lib` and `tutorial` roles (=classes), which are controlled via an additional class on the root listingblock div element:

```html
<div class="listingblock lib">
```
