== About


HTML generated by Rouge is based on a list of token.
Each piece of code is associated to a token.
The following table lists the tokens supported by Rouge.

The list is based on the
https://pygments.org/docs/tokens/[list of Pygments built-in tokens^].

TIP: Within lexers, you'll access these tokens as constants, as in `Keyword::Constant`, and you may use the special aliases `Str` for `Literal::String` and `Num` for `Literal::Number`.
