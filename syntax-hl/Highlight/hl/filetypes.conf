-- File extension and shebang mapping
--
-- Add an entry for a language syntax which is occupied by multiple source file extensions.
-- If there is only one extension, just name the lang file accordingly and it will work (no entry needed here).
-- The filetype entries in gui_files/ext/fileopenfilter.conf should also be updated for the GUI file dialogs.
--
-- Extensions can be configured for multiple languages (see "asm", which is assigned to assembler and fasm).
-- The command line (CLI) and Qt GUI builds handle ambiguous assignments as follows:
--  - CLI: the first association listed here will be used
--  - GUI: a syntax selection prompt will be shown
--
-- If a filename has no extension by convention (ie. makefile), it may be added here nevertheless or be 
-- configured as "Shebang".
--
-- You can assign complete filenames to a syntax, see the "cmake" entry.
--
-- A default input encoding can be set with an EncodingHint attribute (requires v. 3.55).
--
-- The first filetypes.conf found in a highlight search directory wins. See README.adoc for search dirs.
--
-- You can override specific settings in ~/.highlight/filetypes.conf like this:
--
-- dofile "/etc/highlight/filetypes.conf"
--
-- table.insert(FileMapping, { Lang="yourlang", Shebang=[[^#!\s*(/usr)?(/local)?/bin/(env\s+)?yourlang]] })

FileMapping = {
  { Lang="alan", Extensions={"alan", "i"} },
}
