Previews of our custom Rouge lexers and themes for the ALAN Docs project, and other ALAN-related documentation.


[WARNING]
========================
Currently we only have the ALAN lexer, and a single theme.
In the future this document we'll also cover the other required lexers (BNF) and ALAN themes ("tutorial" and "lib").
