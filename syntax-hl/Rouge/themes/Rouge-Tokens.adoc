Quick references for Rouge lexers and themes authors, with emphasis on token names and their corresponding classes in HTML documents, in order to control code styles via custom CSS.

NOTE: Adapted from
https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-tokens[Rouge's Wiki Â» List of tokens^],
released under <<MIT License>>.


== About


HTML generated by Rouge is based on a list of token.
Each piece of code is associated to a token.
The following table lists the tokens supported by Rouge.

The list is based on the
https://pygments.org/docs/tokens/[list of Pygments built-in tokens^].

TIP: Within lexers, you'll access these tokens as constants, as in `Keyword::Constant`, and you may use the special aliases `Str` for `Literal::String` and `Num` for `Literal::Number`.


== Tokens List


The "`Token name`" column shows the tokens identifiers used in the Ruby sources of lexers and themes, whereas the "`Short`" columns shows their CSS class names.
